To make sam:
	make sam

To make the terminal half of sam:
  for x11:
	(cd x11; make -f makex11)

  for suntools:
	(cd x11; make -f makestools)

Sam will search $PATH for xsamterm.  To test a version, just copy
the xsamterm from the x11 directory to the current directory and
type sam.  This works for both x11 and suntools.

Note that you might want to make a symbolic link to sam
in /usr/jerq/bin; then you can use 'sam -r host' to execute
sam remotely.

Ignore all the warnings about enumeration type clashes
during the making of sam.  Sam was developed under a
compiler that does enums properly.
