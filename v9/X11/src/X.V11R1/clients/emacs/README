The following patches are for GNU Emacs V18 (specifically V18.47,
although they should work for earlier versions).  To install X11
capability, copy the files:

xmakefile
emacs.c
xterm.c
xfns.c
xterm.h

from this directory into the "src" directory of the emacs source tree.
Then do another "make".  Your resultant "xemacs" file will run under
X11, but not X10.

If you don't have a copy of GNU Emacs, see the file "DISTRIB" in this
directory for ordering information.

Caveat: This is only a partial port.  Menus have not been
reimplemented, and many of the lisp functions have not been converted
yet.  It should work for normal text editing, however.  Future
versions will be forthcoming.

Among the known bugs: Display flickers horribly during updates, iconifying
  sometimes crashes things, no support for color.
