This is a little X game I've been playing with for a few weeks in an 
attempt to get a feel for how to use X.   Have fun.
If you play with the -s option, you can get some nice looking animation
of the pieces sliding.  On my system,

  puzzle -s50 

works pretty well.  using an S value of 1 or not specifying the option
will cause the pieces to move instantly to their new location.

A parameter with an '=' will be interpreted as a geometry;
A parameter with a ':' will be interpreted as the display to use.
A numeric parameter of n will generate a puzzle of size nxn; not just
  the 4x4 puzzle we all know and love!
