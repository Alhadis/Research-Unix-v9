.SH NAME
X - A network transparent window system for Unix
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
X is a network transparent windowing system developed at MIT which
runs under Ultrix-32 Version 1.2 (and higher), 4.3BSD Unix,
SunOS 3.2 (and higher) and
DOMAIN/IX.  Ports are expected to System V Unix.
.PP
X display servers run on computers with bitmap terminals.
The server
distributes user input to, and accepts output requests from various
client programs located either on the same machine or elsewhere in the
Internet.
While
a client normally runs on the same machine as the X server it is talking
to, this need not be the case.
.PP
X supports overlapping windows, fully recursive subwindows, text and
graphics operations within windows.
For a full explanation of functions, see
``Xlib - C Language X Interface'' document and the X Protocol Definition.
.PP
When you first log in on a display running X, you are
using the \fIxterm(1)\fP terminal emulator program.
You need not learn anything extra to use a display running X as
a terminal beyond moving the mouse cursor into the login window to
log in normally.
.PP
X attempts to provide hooks for your favorite style of user interface;
feel free to write your own if you don't like the style provided by
existing window managers (see \fIwm(1)\fP or \fIuwm(1)\fP).
These programs are used to manipulate existing top level windows,
including  moving, resizing, and iconifying existing windows.
You should start your favorite window manager when you log in
on a display running X.
.PP
Current client programs of X include a terminal emulator (\fIxterm(1)\fP),
window managers (\fIwm(1)\fP and \fIuwm(1)\fP), 
bitmap editor (\fIbitmap(1)\fP),
access control program (\fIxhost(1)\fP),
user preference setting program (\fIxset(1)\fP),
load monitor (\fIxload(1)\fP), clock (\fIxclock(1)\fP),
font displayer (\fIxfd(1)\fP) and demos (\fIico(1)\fP, \fImuncher(1)\fP, etc.)
On some systems, mail notification has been integrated (\fIbiff(1)\fP).
.SH DISPLAY SPECIFICATION
.PP
When you first log in, the environment variable ``DISPLAY'' will be
set to a string ``machine:display'' (for example, ``mit-athena:0'') which
will determine which display an X application will talk to by default.
.PP
Most applications will also interpret an argument with a ``:'' in it
to be the display to use.
.PP
When using DECnet, the format ``node::display'' should be used.
