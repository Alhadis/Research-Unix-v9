/*
**	Reads, modifies, and writes the record in the ``shares'' file

**
**	The function indicated by the "func" argument is called with the address
**	of the original structure, and the address of the structure to be updated.
**
**	Returns value returned by passed function for success and 0 for error
**	But note, that if the function returns 0 itself, then the ``shares'' file
**	will not be updated.
**
**	Otherwise, the value returned by the function is used to update the
**	``extime'' field in the shares record.
